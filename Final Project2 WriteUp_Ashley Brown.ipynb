    "## Project Problem and Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Tipping Point posts messages on Twitter and Facebook but it is not clear what content drives the greatest engagement (likes and shares). This information will be very helpful in informing our social media strategy and identifying the best use of social media resources. Observing Twitter and Facebook data \n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Due to the relevance of the topics and what people see day in and day out, I predict that tweets and Facebook posts related to homelessness and housing will drive the greatest engagement. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will include two parts: 1) building a algorithm to categorize tweets and Facebook posts 2) use regression to evaluate correlation between categories and engagement metrics. "

    "I think I have a good hold on the conceptual aspects of the project and theoretically know what I need to do but am less sure of how to actually set up the data and run the code. \n",
    "\n",

    "The social media lead is data savvy and will do well with detailed steps. He will likely need some additional explanation and translation but is someone that will enjoy taking the information and running with it. \n",
