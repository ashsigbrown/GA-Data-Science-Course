    "Answer: Outliers are data points that fall outside of the range of the rest of the scores and will impact the analysis when analyzing the mean (GRE scores, GPA, or school ranking), outliers can drive the mean away from the bulk of responses. When looking at standard deviations, outliers can incorrectly increase the standard deviation. When analyzing the correlations of GRE score, GPA, or school ranking to those admitted or not admitted, outliers can increase or dcrease the correlation coefficient. The impact of the outliers on the correlation coefficient will depend on the sample size (larger sample size, more mute effect). Since linear regressin is based on these statistics then outliers can throw off the analysis. "
